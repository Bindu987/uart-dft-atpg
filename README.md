# Scan-Based Design-for-Testability and ATPG Implementation for a UART Transmitter

This project implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) Transmitter with integrated scan-based Design-for-Testability (DFT) features using Verilog HDL. It leverages industry-standard EDA tools including ModelSim, Synopsys Design Compiler, and TetraMAX for simulation, synthesis, and test pattern generation.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ RTL design of a UART Transmitter in Verilog HDL.
- 🔁 Scan flip-flop integration to enable full scan chain for DFT.
- ⚙️ Synthesis using Synopsys Design Compiler (both scan and non-scan versions).
- 🧪 ATPG & test coverage analysis using Synopsys TetraMAX.
- 🧼 Gate-level simulation and waveform analysis using ModelSim.
- 📊 Fault coverage achieved: **82.16%** using scan-based ATPG.

## 🔄 Design Flow

1. **RTL Design**: UART modeled with FSM, shift register, and counters.
2. **Functional Simulation**: RTL verification using ModelSim.
3. **Synthesis**: Netlist generation and performance analysis via Design Compiler.
4. **Scan Insertion**: Manual replacement of sequential elements with scan DFFs.
5. **ATPG & Coverage**: Test pattern generation and analysis using TetraMAX.

## ✅ Results

- **Area**: Improved efficiency in scan design
- **Power**: Reduced dynamic power in scan version
